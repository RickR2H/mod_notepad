# Add an offcanvas notepad module in the Administrator area of Joomla 4

- The module uses a simple markdown file to store the notes.
- Location of the markdown file can be added in the settings of the module. Default is site root.
- File can be downloaded from the offcanvas tab.

**NOTE: When the notes are saved the page will be refreshed. Make sure you save you work first before using the notes area. If not, you'll lose your settings.**
